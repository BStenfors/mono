# API Documentation

Any Web API needs a documentation, that's why we created [mono-doc](https://github.com/mono-js/mono-doc).

This module generates a [Nuxt.js](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js) app with the full documentation of your API.

It parses your app's routes of and will generate a web page for your API. All you have to do (optional) is to fill your routes `documentation` (alias `doc`) key. You can find the documentation in the [Mono Doc documentation](https://github.com/mono-js/mono-doc).
