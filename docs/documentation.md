# Documentation

A REST API often needs a documentation, that's why we created [mono-doc](https://github.com/terrajs/mono-doc).

This module generate a [Nuxt](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js) app with the full documentation of your API.

It parses the routes available in your app, all you have to do (optional) is to fill your routes `documentation` key. You can find the documentation in the [routes section](/routes?id=declaration).
